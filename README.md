For now, We have limited our scope to only Burger's Equation but similar procedure can be applied to solve any differential equation, Regardless of it being even highly non-linear.

The differential equation along with its domain of definition and boundary conditions is already given in the notebook with a brief introduction to Physics Informed Neural Networks and how they are used to solve Burger's Equation.

Here, I will be covering some details regarding the Data Generating Process:

When we talk about data here, we just mean the points that we are sampling in order to use for training the Neural Network.

As the Neural Network NN(x,t) ~ u(x,t), and u(x,t) is just the solution of our differential equation.

So, we are sampling some boundary condition points and some general points in the domain of definition in order to impose the rules governed by our PDE (including boundary conditions) to our Neural Network.

Note that we are using g(x) = -sin(Ï€x)

### How sampled points for boundary/initial conditions look like:

| X_u     | t_u        | U_train    |
|---------|------------|------------|
| +1      | [0,1]      | 0          |
| -1      | [0,1]      | 0          |
| [-1,1]  | 0          | g(x)       |

### How general sampled points look like:

| X_f     | t_f        |
|---------|------------|
| [-1,1]  | [0,1]      |
