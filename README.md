Procedure Used to implement PINNs for Solving Burgerâ€™s Equation

1. Data Preparation:
   - Boundary training data (X_u_train) is collected as pairs of (x, t) coordinates.
   - Boundary solution data (u_train) is collected.
   - Collocation points (X_f_train) are collected as pairs of (x, t) coordinates.

2. PINN Initialization:
   - The data arrays are transformed into torch tensors.
   - The neural network (PINN) is defined as a class inheriting from torch.nn.Module.
   - The PINN architecture consists of multiple fully connected layers with a hyperbolic tangent activation function.

3. PINN Forward Pass:
   - The forward method in the NeuralNetwork class defines the forward pass of the PINN.
   - The input (x, t) is passed through the fully connected layers with the activation function.
   - The output represents the function u(x, t).
4. Physics-Informed Neural Network:
   - The PhysicsInformedNN class is defined to handle the PINN operations.
   - The class takes boundary and collocation data as inputs.
   - The class initializes the necessary tensors, the PINN model, and the optimizer (LBFGS).
   - The class defines methods to compute the predicted solution (u) and the residual (f) using automatic differentiation.
5. Training the PINN:
   - The closure method is defined to compute the loss and update the gradients during each optimization step.
   - The train method is called to start the training loop.
   - The closure method is repeatedly called by the optimizer to update the PINN's weights and biases.
   - The loss consists of two components: the boundary condition loss (u_loss) and the PDE loss (f_loss).
   - The sum of these losses is minimized using the LBFGS optimizer.

6. Data Visualization:
   - The plot method is defined to visualize the solution on new data.
   - It generates a meshgrid of (x, t) points and evaluates the PINN's output.
   - The solution is reshaped and plotted using matplotlib.

7. Data Generation:
   - The generate_data function is defined to generate training points for boundary conditions and collocation points.
   - It samples points for boundary conditions (X_u_train) and collocation points (X_f_train).
   - The corresponding solution values (u_train) for the boundary conditions are also generated.

8. Training the Model:
   - The generate_data function is called to obtain the training data.
   - An instance of the PhysicsInformedNN class is created with the training data.
   - The train method is called to train the PINN and find the optimal weights.
